# DSA

Algorithm is a step by step method of solving a problem.
Properties of algorithm 
1) Sequence of finit stepto solve a  problem
2) Independent of programming langauage
3) Produce atleast one output
4) Deterministic
5) it should 0 or more input

  # Time and Space Complexity
1) Criteria chosing an algorithm is time complexity and spacw complexity
2) Time complexity is time taken by an algorithm to execute 
3) Space complexity is extra space required to execute
4) time complexity depends on configuration of particular  system

  # Criterias for complexity
1) Sequence execution is performed
2) 1 unit of arithmetic and logical operation
3) 1 unit for assignment and logical operations
4) 1 unit read and write operation
